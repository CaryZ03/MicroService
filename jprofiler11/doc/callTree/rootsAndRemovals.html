    <p>
      Call trees often contain too much information. When you want to reduce the displayed detail, there are
      several possibilities: you can restrict the displayed data to one particular sub-tree, remove all
      unwanted data, or use a more coarse-grained filter for displaying method calls. All of these strategies
      are supported by JProfiler.
    </p>

    <h3>Setting call tree roots</h3>
    <p>
      If you profile a use case that consists of multiple tasks that run sequentially, each sub-tree can be analyzed
      separately. Once you have found the entry point to such a sub-task, the surrounding call tree is only a
      distraction and the timing percentages in the sub-tree inconveniently refer to the root of the entire call tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      To focus on a particular sub-tree, JProfiler offers the <i>Set As Root</i> context action in the
      call tree and the
      allocation call tree views.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_set_as_root_action.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 783px"></p>
    <p>
      After setting a call tree root, information about the selected root is shown at the top of the view.
      A single scrollable label shows the last few stack elements leading up to the root and a detail dialog
      with the entire stack of the call tree root can be displayed by clicking on the <i>Show More</i> button.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_set_as_root_header.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 783px"></p>
    <p>
      When you use the set root action recursively, the call stack prefixes will simply be concatenated.
      To go back to the previous call tree, you can either use the <i>Back</i> button of the call tree
      history to undo one root change at a time, or the <i>Reset Root And Show All</i> action in
      the context menu to go back to the original tree in a single step.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_backward_action.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 984px"></p>
    <p>
      What is most important about changing the call tree root, is that the hot spots view will show data
      that is calculated for the selected root only, and not for the entire tree. At the top of the hot spots view,
      you will see the current call tree root just like in the call tree view to remind of you the context of the
      displayed data.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_set_as_root_hot_spots.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 783px"></p>

    <h3>Removing parts of the call tree</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes it's helpful to see how the call tree would look like if a certain method was not present.
      For example, this can be the case when you have to fix several performance problems in one go, because
      you are working with a snapshot from a production system that cannot be iterated quickly like in your development
      environment. After solving the main performance problem, you then want to analyze the second one, but that can
      only be seen clearly if the first one is eliminated from the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nodes in the call tree can be removed together with their sub-trees by selecting them and hitting the
      <code>Delete</code> key or by choosing <i>Remove Selected Sub-Tree</i> from the context menu. Times in
      ancestor nodes will be corrected accordingly as if the hidden nodes did not exist.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_remove_action.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 783px"></p>
    <p>
      There are two removal modes. With the <i>All invocations</i> mode, JProfiler searches for all invocations of the
      selected method in the entire call tree and removes them together with their entire sub-trees. The
      <i>Sub-tree only</i> option only removes the selected sub-tree.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_removal_mode.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 386px"></p>
    <p>
      Just like for the <i>Set As Root</i> action, removed nodes influence the hot spots view. In this way, you can
      check what the hot spots would look like if those methods were optimized to the point of not being important
      contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you remove a node, the header area of both the call tree and the hot spots views will show a line with
      the count of the removed nodes and a <i>Restore Remove Sub-Trees</i> button. Clicking on that
      button will bring up a dialog where you can select removed elements that should be be shown again.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_remove_header.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 783px"></p>

    <h3>Call tree view filters</h3>
    <p>
      The third feature in the call that has an influence on the displayed data in the hot spots view is the
      view filter. When you change your call tree filters, it has a large effect on the
      <a href="../main/cpu.html">calculated hot spots</a>. To emphasize this interdependence with the call tree view,
      the hot spots view shows the call tree view filter in a line above the view together with a button to remove the
      additional filters.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_view_filters.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 783px"></p>
    <p>
      Setting a call tree root, removing parts of the call tree and view filters can be used together, with the
      limitation that view filters have to be set last. As soon as view filters are configured in the call tree,
      the <i>Set As Root</i> and <i>&gt;Remove Selected Sub-Tree</i> actions do not work anymore.
    </p>

    <h3>Interaction with the call graph</h3>
    <p>
      Invoking the <i>Show Graph</i> action in either the call tree or the hot spots view will show a graph that is
      limited to the same call tree root, does not include the removed methods and uses the configured call tree view
      filters. At the top of the graph, the information about these changes is displayed in a similar form as in the
      call tree.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/roots_graph_wizard_options.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 636px"></p>
    <p>
      When creating a new graph in the graph view itself, check boxes in the wizard let you choose which of these
      call tree adjustment features should be taken into account for the calculation of the call graph. Each check box
      is only visible if the corresponding feature is currently used in the call tree view.
    </p>
