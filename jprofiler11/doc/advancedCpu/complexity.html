      The complexity analysis view allows you to investigate the algorithmic complexity of selected methods
      depending on their method parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      To refresh the details on big O notation, an
      <a href="https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/" target="_blank">introduction to algorithmic complexity</a>
      and a comparative guide to <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/" target="_blank">complexities for common algorithms</a>
      are recommended readings.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, you have to select one or more methods that should be monitored.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/complexity_config.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 586px"></p>
    <p>
      For each method, you can then enter a script whose return value of type
      <code>long</code> is used as the complexity for the current method call. For example, if one of the method
      parameters of type <code>java.util.Collection</code> is named <code>inputs</code>, the script
      could be <code>inputs.size()</code>.

    <p>
      Complexity recording is independent of CPU recording. You can start and stop complexity recording directly
      in the complexity analysis view or by using a
      <a href="../main/recording.html">recording profile or a trigger action</a>.
      After recording has been stopped, a graph with the results is displayed plotting the complexities on the x-axis
      against the execution times on the y-axis. To reduce memory requirements, JProfiler can combine different
      complexities and execution times into common buckets. The drop-down at the top allows you to switch
      between the different configured methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The graph is a bubble chart, where the size of each data point is proportional to the amount of measurements
      in it. If all measurements are distinct, you will see a regular scatter chart. In the other extreme, if all
      method invocations have the same complexity and execution time, you will see a single large circle.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/complexity_analysis.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 784px"></p>

    <p>
      If there are at least 3 data points, a curve fit with common complexities is shown. JProfiler
      tries curve fits from several common complexities and initially shows you the best fit. The drop-down for the
      curve fits allows you to show other curve fit models as well. The R<sup>2</sup> value embedded in the
      description of the curve fit shows you how good the fit is. The models in the drop-down are sorted in
      descending order with respect to R<sup>2</sup>, so the best model is always the first item.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/complexity_fits.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 583px"></p>
    <p>
      Note that R<sup>2</sup> can be negative, because it is just a notation and not really the square of anything.
      Negative values indicate a fit that is worse than a fit with a constant line. The constant line fit always has
      an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0 and a perfect fit has a value of 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can export the parameters of the currently displayed fit by choosing the "Properties" option in the
      export dialog. For automated analysis in a quality assurance environment, the
      <a href="../commandLine/snapshotExecutables.html">command line export</a> supports the properties format
      as well.
