    <p>
      When you profile your application, the methods and classes that come up in JProfiler's views often lead to
      questions that can only be answered by looking their source code. While JProfiler provides a built-in source code
      viewer for that purpose, it has limited functionality. Also, when a problem is found, the next move is usually to
      edit the offending code. Ideally, there should be a direct path from the profiling views in JProfiler to the IDE,
      so you can inspect and improve code without any manual lookups.
    </p>

    <h3>Installing IDE integrations</h3>
    <p>
      JProfiler offers IDE integrations for IntelliJ IDEA, eclipse and NetBeans. To install an IDE plugin, invoke
      <i>Session-&gt;IDE Integrations</i> from the main menu.
      The installer also offers this action to make it easy to update the IDE plugin along with the JProfiler
      installation. JProfiler writes a property file into the plugin directory that connects the plugin with
      the current installation directory of JProfiler. In the IDE plugin settings, you can change the used version of
      JProfiler at any time. The protocol between the plugin and the JProfiler GUI is backwards compatible and can work
      with older versions of JProfiler as well.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/ide_integrations.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 616px"></p>
    <p>
      The IntelliJ IDEA integration can also be installed from the plugin manager. In that case, the plugin will ask you
      for the location of the JProfiler executable when you profile for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On different platforms, the JProfiler executable is located in different directories. On Windows, it's
      <code class="executable">bin\jprofiler.exe</code>, on Linux or Unix <code class="executable">bin/jprofiler</code> and
      on macOS there is a special helper shell script <code class="executable">Contents/Resources/app/bin/macos/jprofiler.sh</code>
      in the JProfiler application bundle for the IDE integrations.
    </p>

    <h3>Source code navigation</h3>
    <p>
      Everywhere a class name or a method name is shown in JProfiler, the context menu contains a <i>Show Source</i>
      action.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/ide_show_source_action.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 784px"></p>
    <p>
      If the session was not started from the IDE, the built-in source code viewer is shown that
      utilizes line number tables in the compiled class files to find methods. A source file can only be found
      if its root directory or a containing ZIP file is configured in the application settings
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/ide_source_path.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 786px"></p>
    <p>
      Together with the source code display, a bytecode viewer based on the
      <a href="https://github.com/ingokegel/jclasslib" target="_blank">jclasslib bytecode viewer</a>
      shows the structure of the compiled class file.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/ide_bytecode_viewer.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 686px"></p>
    <p>
      If the session is launched from the IDE, the integrated source code viewer is not used and the
      <i>Show Source</i> action defers to the IDE plugin. The IDE integrations support launched profiling sessions,
      opening saved snapshots as well as attaching to running JVMs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For live profiling sessions, you start the profiled application for the IDE similarly to running or debugging it.
      The JProfiler plugin will then insert the VM parameter for profiling and connect a JProfiler window to it.
      JProfiler is running as a separate process and is started by the plugin if required. Source code navigation
      requests from JProfiler are sent to the associated project in the IDE. JProfiler and the IDE plugin cooperate
      to make window switching seamless without blinking task bar entries, just as if you were dealing with a single
      process.
    </p>
    <p>
      When starting the session, the "Session startup" dialog lets you configure all profiling settings.
      The configured profiling settings that are used for a launched session are remembered by JProfiler on a
      per-project or on a per-run-configuration basis, depending on the IDE integrations. When a session is profiled
      for the first time, the IDE plugin automatically determines a list of profiled packages
      based on the topmost classes in the package hierarchy of your source files. At any later point, you can go to the
      filter settings step in the session settings dialog and use the reset button to perform this calculation again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For snapshots, the IDE integration is set up by opening a snapshot file from within the IDE with the
      <i>File-&gt;Open</i> action or by double-clicking on it in the project window. Source code
      navigation from JProfiler will then be directed into the current project. Finally, the IDE plugin adds an
      <i>Attach to JVM</i> action to the IDE that lets you select a running JVM and get source code navigation into the
      IDE, similar to the mechanism for snapshots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes you may want to switch to the IDE without a particular class or method in mind. For that purpose,
      the tool bar in the JProfiler window has an <i>Activate IDE</i> button that is shown for profiling sessions
      that are opened by an IDE integration. The action is bound to the <code>F11</code> key, just like the JProfiler
      activation action in the IDE, so you can switch back and forth between the IDE and JProfiler with the same key
      binding.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ui/ide_activate_ide_action.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 784px"></p>

    <h3>IntelliJ IDEA integration</h3>
    <p>
      To profile your application from IntelliJ IDEA, choose one of the profiling commands in the
      <i>Run</i> menu, the context menu in the editor, or click on the corresponding
      toolbar button.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_idea_toolbar.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 426px"></p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_idea_menu.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 347px"></p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_idea_context.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 284px"></p>
    <p>
      JProfiler can profile most run configuration types from IDEA, including applications servers. To
      configure further settings, edit the run configuration, choose the <i>Startup/Connection</i> tab,
      and select the <i>JProfiler</i> entry. The screen shot below shows the startup settings for a
      local server configuration. Depending on the run configuration type, you can adjust JVM options
      or retrieve profiling parameters for remote profiling.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_idea_server.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 650px"></p>
    <p>
      The profiled application is then started just as with the usual "Run" commands. Precise source code navigation
      is implemented for Java and Kotlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the <i>JProfiler</i> tab of the IDE settings, you can adjust the used JProfiler executable and whether you
      always want to open a new window in JProfiler for new profiling sessions.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_idea_settings.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 690px"></p>
    <p>
      The JProfiler tool window in IDEA is shown when you profile a run configuration from IDEA, when you open a
      JProfiler snapshot or when you attach to a running JVM.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_idea_tool_window.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 561px"></p>
    <p>
      The action in the tool bar with the JProfiler icon activates the JProfiler window. On the right side of the tool bar,
      several toggle buttons give access to important recording actions in JProfiler. If a recording is active, the
      corresponding toggle button is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of particular relevance is the <i>CPU recording</i> action, because CPU graph data can be shown directly in the
      IDE. The only parameter for graph calculation that is offered in the IDE is the thread status. To configure
      advanced parameters like thread selection or to use the call tree root, call tree removal and call tree view
      filter settings from the call tree view, you can generate the graph in the JProfiler window, it will then be
      shown in the IDE as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you calculate a graph, the list of hot spots will be populated and the source code will be annotated with
      gutter icons for incoming and outgoing calls. The popup on the gutter icons shows an inline graph, clicking
      on a method will navigate to it. The list of hot spots shows you interesting entry points for analyzing the graph.
      When double-clicking on a table row, the source code is shown.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_idea_graph_popup.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 666px"></p>
    <p>
      The <i>Show in JProfiler</i> button contains actions that activate the JProfiler window, either the
      selected node in the method graph or the corresponding call tree analysis in the method graph.
      For outgoing calls, the "Cumulated outgoing calls" analysis is offered, for the incoming calls, the
      "Backtraces" analysis is shown. All these actions are also available in the context menu of the hot spot list
      or as keyboard actions.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_idea_keyboard.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 681px"></p>

    <h3>eclipse integration</h3>
    <p>
      The eclipse plugin can profile most common launch configuration types including test run configurations
      and WTP run configurations. The eclipse plugin only works with the full eclipse SDKs and not with partial
      installations of the eclipse framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      To profile your application from eclipse, choose one of the profiling commands in the
      <i>Run</i> menu or click on the corresponding toolbar button. The profile
      commands are equivalent to the debug and run commands in eclipse and are part of eclipse's
      infrastructure, except for the <i>Run-&gt;Attach JProfiler to JVM</i> menu item
      which is added by the JProfiler plugin.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_eclipse3_toolbar.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 720px"></p>
    <p><img src="../images/ide_eclipse3_menu.png" alt="" onclick="showEnlarged(this)" class="scaledImg" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; max-width: 409px"></p>
    <p>
      If the menu item <i>Run-&gt;Profile ...</i> does not exist in the Java perspective,
      enable the "Profile" actions for this perspective under
      <i>Window-&gt;Perspective-&gt;Customize Perspective</i>
      by bringing the <i>Action Set Availability</i> tab to front and selecting the <i>Profile</i> checkbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several JProfiler-related settings including the location of the JProfiler executable can be adjusted in
      eclipse under <i>Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;JProfiler</i>.
    </p>

    <h3>NetBeans integration</h3>
    <p>
      In NetBeans, you can profile standard, free form and maven projects. For free form projects,
      you have to debug your application once before trying to profile it, because the required file
      <code>nbproject/ide-targets.xml</code> is set up by the debug action. JProfiler will add a
      target named "profile-jprofiler" to it with the same contents as the debug target and will try to modify
      the VM parameters as needed. If you have problems profiling a free form project, check the
      implementation of this target.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can profile web applications with the integrated Tomcat or with any other
      Tomcat server configured in NetBeans. When your main project is a web project, selecting
      <i>Profile main project with JProfiler</i> starts the Tomcat server with profiling enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use NetBeans with the bundled GlassFish Server and your main project is set up to use a GlassFish Server,
      selecting <i>Profile main project with JProfiler</i> starts the application server with profiling enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      To profile your application from NetBeans, choose one of the profiling commands in the
      <i>Run</i> menu or click on the corresponding toolbar button.
    </p>
