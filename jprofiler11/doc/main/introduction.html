    <h3>What is JProfiler?</h3>
    <p>
      JProfiler is a professional tool for analyzing what is going on inside a running JVM. You can use it in
      development, for quality assurance and for firefighting missions when your production system experiences problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four main topics that JProfiler deals with:
    </p>
    <ul><li><p><span class="sectionTitle">Method calls</span></p>
        This is commonly called "CPU profiling". Method calls can be measured and visualized in different ways.
        The analysis of method calls helps you to understand what your application is doing and find ways to
        improve its performance.
      </li><li><p><span class="sectionTitle">Allocations</span></p>
        Analyzing objects on the heap with respect to their allocations, reference chains and garbage collection
        falls into the category of "memory profiling". This functionality enables you to fix memory leaks, use less
        memory in general and allocate fewer temporary objects.
      </li><li><p><span class="sectionTitle">Threads and locks</span></p>
        Threads can hold locks, for example by synchronizing on an object. When multiple threads cooperate, deadlocks
        can occur and JProfiler can visualize them for you. Also, locks can be contended, meaning that threads
        have to wait before they can acquire them. JProfiler provides insight into threads and their various
        locking situations.
      </li><li><p><span class="sectionTitle">Higher level subsystems</span></p>
        Many performance problems occur on a higher semantic level. For example, with JDBC calls, you probably want to
        find out which SQL statement is the slowest. For subsystems like that, JProfiler offers "probes" that attach
        specific payloads to the call tree.
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      JProfiler's UI is delivered as a desktop application. You can interactively profile a live JVM or profile
      automatically without using the UI. Profiling data is persisted in snapshots that can be opened with the
      JProfiler UI. In addition, command line tools and build tool integrations help you with automating profiling
      sessions.

    <h3>How do I continue?</h3>
    <p>
      This documentation is intended to be read in sequence, with later help topics building on the content of previous
      ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a technical overview over the <a href="../main/architecture.html">architecture</a> will help you
      to understand how profiling works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The help topics on <a href="../main/installing.html">installing JProfiler</a> and
      <a href="../main/profiling.html">profiling JVMs</a> will get you up and running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following that, the discussion of <a href="../main/recording.html">data recording</a> and
      <a href="../main/snapshots.html">snapshots</a> take you to a level of understanding where you can
      explore JProfiler on your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequent chapters build your expertise with respect to different functionality in JProfiler. The
      sections at the end are optional readings that should be consulted if you need certain
      features.
    </p>
